</div><h1 >P E R S O N A L&nbsp&nbsp W E B S I T E</h1> <div class="modalContent"> <div class="text" id="modal1-1"> <p> Every developer and designer needs a personal website, especially in today's world.<br/> <br/> This project was a means for me to rapidly set up a platform to showcase my work, as well as play around with some new technologies. My intent with this project was to allow potential recruiters and managers to get a sense of who I was, the work that I’ve done, and the work that I am currently doing for this upcoming recruiting season. </p></div>



<div class="text" id="modal1-2"> <p> I knew from the very beginning that I wanted a site that was simple and fast. I’ve always been rather ambivalent about personal websites that required loading animations simply because the site was utilizing too many scripts or server calls. Hence, I chose to make this site entirely static using Hugo. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Full responsive site</li><li>Fast: minimize load times</li><li>Clear and concise portfolio presentation</li><li>Use Hugo, a static-site generator</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>


<div class="text" id="modal1-3"> <p> In terms of the design aesthetic of this site, I wanted to venture away from the flat, round aesthetic that I saw as the norm right now for tech. I used monotone colors, lots of whitespace, and a serif font to attempt a design that might be more reminiscent of a lifestyle magazine or design publication. </p><p> I will admit, the aesthetic I chose to use for this site is more trendy than anything (especially in contrast to my usual designs), but I had a lot of fun playing around with a different style. </p><p> I was actually inspired by a recent trend I’ve been seeing on Instagram which utilizes a lot of whitespace and asymmetrical positioning: </p></div>

<div class="showcase"> <img class="inspoImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/inspo1.PNG"/> <img class="inspoImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/inspo2.PNG"/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal1-4"> <p> My design thinking was to go for minimal. I enjoyed the look of a monotone color because it didn’t distract from any of the content I wanted to show. For the font, I wanted to use a serif typeface for most of the main headers to point to the experience of perusing through a magazine. I thought Baskerville was suffice. In my case study modals, I used Avenir Next for readability. The scrollspy on the case study modals used Montserrat instead of Baskerville or Avenir Next because I wanted to actually call attention to it since it guided the case studies, whereas the scrollspy on the main page was just a fun little feature. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset1.png"/>


<div id="colorBlock1"> <div id="modal1Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#4F4F4F</span></div><div id="modal1Color2"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#E3E3E3</span></div></div></div><div class="text" id="modal1-5"> <p> My execution process began with designing mockups on AdobeXD. The starting point of my design was a consideration of the fact that I was building my site on a static-site generator. Of course, implementing multiple pages was a trivial concern, I felt it easier to just have a single-page scrollable portfolio site with modal views. The user experience starts at the top of the site and ends at the bottom - nothing else to it. </p><p> What you see on this site right now is more or less exactly how I designed it on my final mockup. As mentioned before, I had the intent to build this project rapidly within a 24 hour timeframe because of the upcoming recruiting season. Thus, this project lacked the usual iteration cycle I would’ve gone through for my designs. </p><p> The biggest point of deliberation in my design process was to what detail my ‘work experience’ section would be: </p></div>


<div class="showcase"> <img class="prototypeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/prototype1.png"/> <img class="prototypeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/prototype2.png"/> <div class="prototypeTitles"> <h3>Design 01</h3> <h3>Design 02</h3> </div></div><div class="text"> <p> In Design 01, I included detailed information about my work experience. In Design 02, I removed the detailed information and included a section for my other projects. Of course, my final design was Design 02 sans the ‘other projects’ section. </p><p> Ultimately, I came to my decision as I thought back to my initial objective of having a clear and concise presentation of my portfolio. I saw the detailed information as something I could save for an interview so I moved away from Design 01. However, I later decided to just add a 'read more' view for the detailed information to compromise on the design and the content. With regards to Design 02, I actually see it as a part of future development for this project, but I removed it because I wanted to include better projects still currently in development. </p><p> In terms of actual development, I really wanted to use this portfolio project to try out a static-site generator. I chose Hugo arbitrarily and went with it. To take advantage of the Hugo "boilerplate", I created a collection of partials for every new section in the portfolio such as "case studies", "work experience", or "contact". Responsivity in this project was trivial to develop for because of the simplicity of the layout. I didn't even have to use a grid system because of the fact that nearly all my content was packed into a single middle column. I am a fan of viewport sizing in my CSS so that was how I chose to implement responsivity into this site. </p><p> Finally, I needed a personal logo of some sort. I didn't have very many ideas because of the shortened time frame and the fact that I really didn't like personal logos so I made a circle with a color gradient similar to the photos I had on the site: </p><img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/personallogo.png"/> </div>



<div class="text" id="modal1-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> Hugo is powerful! I definitely didn’t utilize Hugo to its fullest potential because I wanted to get this project out on to the web as quickly as possible. For future development, I’m going to refactor some of my code to use the Hugo templating engine even more so than what I've already done on the site for things like my case studies section or even the work experience section </li><br/> <li> I wish I had taken the time to utilize SCSS. Knowing I was going to take a minimalist design approach, I didn’t think my CSS was going to be to complicated, but perhaps a rule of thumb is to just use it always </li><li> I think I may have simplified too much for my case study modals. I was limited in my positioning a lot of times so I will want to change it in the future </li><br/> </ul> </p></div></div></div></div><div id="caseModal2"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modalScroller"> <ul id="topMenu2"> <li class="modalScrollerItem active"><a href="#modal2-1"><span class="modalSubscript">01</span>OVERVIEW</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-2"><span class="modalSubscript">02</span>PROBLEM</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-3"><span class="modalSubscript">03</span>OBJECTIVES</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-4"><span class="modalSubscript">04</span>CONCEPT</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-5"><span class="modalSubscript">05</span>STYLING</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-6"><span class="modalSubscript">06</span>PROTOTYPES</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-7"><span class="modalSubscript">07</span>SOLUTION</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-8"><span class="modalSubscript">08</span>RESULTS</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-9"><span class="modalSubscript">09</span>TAKEAWAYS</a></li></ul> <div class="close-caseModal2 btn-close-modal">&lt;- B A C K</div></div>

I was tasked with re-designing the interface to be more engaging, efficient, and global to use,   In order to accurately identity users needs. I conducted focus groups that would allow end-users give us feedback about their experience with Armour Desk.This project was my first experience working in sketch and working through the UI development cycle which included conducting background research, online surveys, competitive analysis, focus groups, visual mockups and interactive prototypes. 
 </p></div>  


<div class="text" id="modal2-2"> <br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is Armour Desk?</h3> <p>Armour Desk is Under Armour’s web application that allow employees to access an online help desk. This application allows users to log incidents, request hardware/software, submit change requests, onboard new employees, and more.
 </p><p> The Problem with the current model of Armour Desk is it’s lack of functionality and outdated interface. My goal was to pain point the problems and work on resolving the issues to help develop a new model of Armour Desk.  The beginning of my summer at Under Armour I did background research understanding the back end portal of Armour Desk, which is called ServiceNow. I was trained to understand how the end user is enable to submit a incident, request hardware/software, onboard employees and provisioning consultants. 
 </p><br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">UX - PHASE 01</h3> <p> To Start, I sent out a survey to departments across the company regarding their experience with Armour Desk. My survey included many different questions about the application, but of course, the most important question is: </p><img class="oldArmourImages"data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/c1f155bb/images/survey%20report.png"/> <h4 style="text-align:center;">What might improve experience with Armour Desk?</h4> <p> The responses I received from users across the company was: </p><p style="text-align:center;"> “More clear Navigation.” </p><br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">UX - PHASE 02</h3> <p>The next step I sat down with the end-users and listen to what they have to say about Armour Desk. I noticed myself that the application is unintuitive, difficult to navigate through, and simply outdated in terms of design patterns.</p><img class="oldArmourImages"data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/880e7e85/images/Armour%20Desk%20Homepage.png"/> <p> This image about is the current landing page for Armour Desk. I indented several problems with Armour Desk: unresponsive site, lack of intuitive and helpful navigation system, and the layout is very unorganized.</p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/84398ab3/images/Service%20Catalog.png"/> <img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/84398ab3/images/Hardware%20Request.png"/> <p> The service catalog page is very overwhelming.<br/> There is so many options and the end-user is confused on where to go, I had trouble navigation finding what I need even for a simple request for a loaner . For instance, the hardware request was the first catalog item that I saw since it was listed first.</p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/84398ab3/images/Status%20Page.png"/> <p> The status page was designed for the end-user to check the status for any demands they request, incidents that they report, or any task that I have assigned. However, the feature of this page is lacking. People are questioning why is there a tab called “Incident and Request if I can go to the status page.” </p><br/> </div> 

<div class="text" id="modal2-3"> <p>After conducting my background research and focus group, I identified a single overarching objective for this project: a  
<strong>simple</strong> minimalist design.</p><p>I learned that Under Armour is a company that strives to “Find A Better Way”, which mean how can better understand a system within the scope of own role and support creativity & innovation in others by listening to Teammates’s ideas , sharing our own perspective, strengthen our capabilities, and creating consistency globally , which help the go-to market process. I saw how the design and interface of Armour Desk was causing Under Armour to lose precious time to trying to figure out how to utilize employee service delivery. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Redesign Armour Desk to be more Engaging, Efficient, and Global to use.</li><li> Serve the needs of all users by letting them easily find what they are seeking.</li><li>Provide a pleasant and delightful experience to all users by making it easy for them to complete their task.</li><li>Be strategic and nimble, and focus on making our content useful, interactive, and engaging. 
</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>

<div class="text" id="modal2-4"> <p> One of my main objectives was to re-design the interface to be minimalist. I used some inspiration from the Under Armour E-commerces, and try to bring that UA feel to the Armour Desk platform. Knowing that I was making a help desk application; I wanted it to be simple and user-friendly.
 </p><p> When I think of keeping something simple; I think of other companies who follow that mind-set. For instance, like apple. I love Apple and their aesthetic and minimalist design, which encourage me to bring that feel to life with Armour Desk.  </p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/8ee83d15/images/apple.png"/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </div> 


<div class="text" id="modal2-5"> <p> In terms of styling, I followed Under Armour’s branding guidelines. I utilized their general color scheme as well as the custom ‘Armour’ typeface. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset2.png"/> <div id="colorBlock2"> <div id="modal2Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#DC001C</span></div><div id="modal2Color2"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#222628</span></div><div id="modal2Color3"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#D3D6DC</span></div></div></div><div class="text" id="modal2-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Prototypes</h3> <p> Below are some of the mockups I developed in Sketch. Several factors had to be considered is the application has to be simple for the end-user to use.</p></div>


<div class="showcase"> <img class="mockupImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/Landing%20Page.png"/> <img class="mockupImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/User%20Profile.png"/> </div><div class="text" id="modal2-7"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Final Design</h3> <p> Below are some highlights and design callouts of the final approved design: </p></div>


<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/SC.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I tried to guide the user to see the search bar first when accessing Armour Desk so that they could utilize it to find what they were looking for, rather than clicking through long lists. Not to mention in the screenshot, I wanted to simplify the service catalog to 4 different categories with a description at the bottom, so the user can know what they are clicking on. </p></div></div>


<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/Help%20Page.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I designed a help page for the end-user, so if they get lost or have questions they can come to this page. I added a live chat feature, so the user can interactive with someone at the helpdesk without walking up to the helpdesk. </p></div></div>

<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/Login%20accident.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I developed form templates for the user to log an incident. This screenshot here is simple form to log an problem. These pages are meant to be easily accessible from the search bar on the landing page. </p> </div></div>


<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/jonesgreg/greg-jones.github.io/f6560166/images/Mac%20Accessories.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> Cool thing about the helpdesk you can purchase accessories and software. For instance, there's a page I designed for the mac accessories.This design was inspired by apple itself lol. I went for a grid layout and wanted the images to "pop out" more. I'm just trying to keep it simple!</p></div></div>


<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/solution6.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> Above every page I implemented a breadcrumb interface to allow for quick navigation if the user had forgotten where they had come from in the portal, as well as a search bar with the same functionality as the one on the landing page </p></div></div><div class="videoBlock"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">UI Demo</h4> <p> Before I left Under Armour, I recorded a quick walkthrough of most of the features described above. </p><video controls> <source src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/ArmourDeskDemo.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> </div>


</div><div class="text" id="modal2-8"> <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Under Armour will be the most digitally connected, real-time enterprise on the planet.”</h2> <h3 style="text-align:right;">Kevin Plank<br/>CEO, Under Armour</h3> <p> One of my key objectives was to optimize the Armour Desk web application. I used Google’s Lighthouse analytics software to run tests on the old Armour Desk and my new Armour Desk, and then compared their Perceptual Speed Index (PSI). </p><p> An on average comparison of PSI of pages on both Armour Desk applications: </p><img style="width:100%" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/results1.png"/> <p> Comparing the PSI by ratio, the analytics software determined that my new Armour Desk was <strong>~12x faster</strong> than the old application in terms of page loading time. </p><p> How did I do this? After I had finalized my design, I tested the old Armour Desk application on a variety of fronts such as responsivity, speed, etc. I eventually found that the old application had a whole bunch of client and server scripts running not only when the page loaded, but also throughout the time the user was on the page (like a while-looped function). </p><p> I deduced those scripts were what bogged down the old application’s PSI so in my development I made sure to reduce the amount of scripts and functions the application used overall. All the data on my application was pulled from the ServiceNow instance Under Armour was using so I also minimized the amount of API calls my application was making. </p><p> Since my summer at Under Armour, the Armour Desk application I developed has been put into full production and thousands of employees use it on a daily basis. </p></div>


<div class="text" id="modal2-9"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> I thoroughly enjoyed the process of iterating through design concepts to meet the needs of my team and Under Armour along with putting my own little aesthetic into the final product </li><br/> <li> Picking up a brand new framework and jumping into an existing codebase was a new experience for me. There were days where I couldn’t even look at the existing codebase because I had to look at Angular documentation to understand why even the navbar was rendering the way it was, but this project definitely taught me a lot about looking at and working with somebody else’s code </li><br/> <li> For future projects, I want to allocate more time for testing afterwards. There were definitely some usage patterns that I didn’t think about until after I had completed everything, so I think a greater consideration for UX not only before but after the end of a project is critical </li></ul> </p></div></div></div>

 <div class="modalContent"> <div class="text" id="modal3-1"> <p> I love a minimalistic asesthetic. I enjoy simple and clean interfaces, and I appreciate them even more when I see them executed with my favorite brands. </p><p> Norse Projects is a clothing brand founded by designer Tobia Sloth based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I think the beauty of the Norse aesthetic, especially with regards to its e-commerce site, is its modern simplicity. However, I also think that the simplicity has limited the site in terms of proper user-experience, so this redesign was a concept for the Norse Projects website to better suit the needs of its online consumers. </p></div>



 <div class="text" id="modal3-2"> <p> In doing this redesign, I wanted to make sure I could retain the core aspects of the Norse aesthetic in its simplicity, but also inject more points of interest in the design through textures and patterns. Shown below is how Norse Projects online store looks like right now: </p><img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-1.png"/> <img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-2.png"/> <p> As mentioned previously, I felt that the UX of the site itself could be improved. For instance, one thing that I really enjoy about Norse Projects’ online presence is its frequently updated “Journal”. Specifically, the “Journal” is where Norse releases its seasonal lookbooks, but you would never know it unless you actively went into that part of the site to look for it. </p><p> Of course, the current website does allow user to filter clothing by “season”, but even then, I felt that the website missed out on an opportunity to better showcase its lookbook editorial images. </p><img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-3.png"/> <p> With specific regards to the “Journal” page shown above, I felt that it also missed the mark in terms of good UX. Navigation was dificult, and filtering by timestamp for the journal entries was not effectively done. </p></div>


 <div class="text" id="modal3-3"> <p> The overarching theme of my objectives in this redesign project was delightful UX. Not only did I want to conceptualize a slightly more involved website in terms of design, but also allow users to naturally be at the pages they wanted to be at on the site, as well as allow for easy navigation to other parts of the site when needed. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Slight aesthetic revamp</li><li>Highlight the lookbook editorials</li><li>Redesign the "Journal" page for better UX</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>


 <div class="text" id="modal3-4"> <p> Conceptually, I thought the Norse Projects website could better serve its users by focusing on its seasonal editorials so I designed for a lookbook-centered website. I thought this was an effective aspect to focus on because I felt that from my own experience as a consumer, I only went to shop on the Norse Projects website for the new arrivals for a seasonal drop. Generally for me, if I wanted an old piece from a previous collection, I bought it from third-party because either the piece was no longer available on the site, or I could find it at a discounted price elsewhere. Specifically, this lookbook-concept revolves around the Autumn 2017 collection, though I dubbed it FW17 in my design just for fun. </p><p> From an aesthetic standpoint, Norse Projects designers and content creators love highlighting their subject naturally with a white, plain background: </p></div>

<div class="text"> <p> As I mentioned before, my objective was to add a slight complexity to this aesthetic to challenge the the current art direction. I was actually mostly inspired by what Norse has been doing on their instagram with some of their recent collaborations: </p></div>

<div class="text"> <p> The above images illustrate a design that contrasts two defining elements. The elements themselves are still rather simple but, surprisingly enough, complement one another in juxtaposition. </p><br/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-5"> <p> With regards to styling, I mostly kept to Norse Project’s font face, still tried to utilize only monotone colors throughout so there wouldn’t be too much deviation from the current aesthetic, and organized within a 4 column grid. In only one instance did I use Gotham Black for the FW17 collection landing to get a bolder feel to the image. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset3.png"/> <div id="colorBlock3"> <div id="modal3Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#000000</span></div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">NORSE PROJECTS <br/>FW17 CAMPAIGN WEBSITE </h3> </div>

<div class="showcase"> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-landing.jpg"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-2.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-3.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-5.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-4.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-journal.jpg"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-mobile.jpg"/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-7"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> This was a design project that pushed my design thinking not because it was an abstract concept or anything, but really more from the fact that I was iterating on someone else’s work and design. Generally, my designs have been inspired and driven from the ground up from my own creativity, but it was a fun experience taking what someone had already created and looking for ways to improve it or aesthetically alter it. </li><br/> <li> Typeface pairing can be dificult when there are constraints to a particular aesthetic you are trying to achieve. There were moments where I really wanted to use a serif font for some of the FW17 campaign materials, but I kept in mind that Norse Projects was a brand that wouldn't use such a font. As a result, I had to work my design to stay in line with the branding of Norse Projects, and I realized that such a dilemma will always be the case when working with real-world clients. </li></ul> </p></div></div></div></div>
