</div><h1 >P E R S O N A L&nbsp&nbsp W E B S I T E</h1> <div class="modalContent"> <div class="text" id="modal1-1"> <p> Every developer and designer needs a personal website, especially in today's world.<br/> <br/> This project was a means for me to rapidly set up a platform to showcase my work, as well as play around with some new technologies. My intent with this project was to allow potential recruiters and managers to get a sense of who I was, the work that I’ve done, and the work that I am currently doing for this upcoming recruiting season. </p></div>



<div class="text" id="modal1-2"> <p> I knew from the very beginning that I wanted a site that was simple and fast. I’ve always been rather ambivalent about personal websites that required loading animations simply because the site was utilizing too many scripts or server calls. Hence, I chose to make this site entirely static using Hugo. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Full responsive site</li><li>Fast: minimize load times</li><li>Clear and concise portfolio presentation</li><li>Use Hugo, a static-site generator</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>


<div class="text" id="modal1-3"> <p> In terms of the design aesthetic of this site, I wanted to venture away from the flat, round aesthetic that I saw as the norm right now for tech. I used monotone colors, lots of whitespace, and a serif font to attempt a design that might be more reminiscent of a lifestyle magazine or design publication. </p><p> I will admit, the aesthetic I chose to use for this site is more trendy than anything (especially in contrast to my usual designs), but I had a lot of fun playing around with a different style. </p><p> I was actually inspired by a recent trend I’ve been seeing on Instagram which utilizes a lot of whitespace and asymmetrical positioning: </p></div>

<div class="showcase"> <img class="inspoImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/inspo1.PNG"/> <img class="inspoImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/inspo2.PNG"/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal1-4"> <p> My design thinking was to go for minimal. I enjoyed the look of a monotone color because it didn’t distract from any of the content I wanted to show. For the font, I wanted to use a serif typeface for most of the main headers to point to the experience of perusing through a magazine. I thought Baskerville was suffice. In my case study modals, I used Avenir Next for readability. The scrollspy on the case study modals used Montserrat instead of Baskerville or Avenir Next because I wanted to actually call attention to it since it guided the case studies, whereas the scrollspy on the main page was just a fun little feature. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset1.png"/>


<div id="colorBlock1"> <div id="modal1Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#4F4F4F</span></div><div id="modal1Color2"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#E3E3E3</span></div></div></div><div class="text" id="modal1-5"> <p> My execution process began with designing mockups on AdobeXD. The starting point of my design was a consideration of the fact that I was building my site on a static-site generator. Of course, implementing multiple pages was a trivial concern, I felt it easier to just have a single-page scrollable portfolio site with modal views. The user experience starts at the top of the site and ends at the bottom - nothing else to it. </p><p> What you see on this site right now is more or less exactly how I designed it on my final mockup. As mentioned before, I had the intent to build this project rapidly within a 24 hour timeframe because of the upcoming recruiting season. Thus, this project lacked the usual iteration cycle I would’ve gone through for my designs. </p><p> The biggest point of deliberation in my design process was to what detail my ‘work experience’ section would be: </p></div>


<div class="showcase"> <img class="prototypeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/prototype1.png"/> <img class="prototypeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/prototype2.png"/> <div class="prototypeTitles"> <h3>Design 01</h3> <h3>Design 02</h3> </div></div><div class="text"> <p> In Design 01, I included detailed information about my work experience. In Design 02, I removed the detailed information and included a section for my other projects. Of course, my final design was Design 02 sans the ‘other projects’ section. </p><p> Ultimately, I came to my decision as I thought back to my initial objective of having a clear and concise presentation of my portfolio. I saw the detailed information as something I could save for an interview so I moved away from Design 01. However, I later decided to just add a 'read more' view for the detailed information to compromise on the design and the content. With regards to Design 02, I actually see it as a part of future development for this project, but I removed it because I wanted to include better projects still currently in development. </p><p> In terms of actual development, I really wanted to use this portfolio project to try out a static-site generator. I chose Hugo arbitrarily and went with it. To take advantage of the Hugo "boilerplate", I created a collection of partials for every new section in the portfolio such as "case studies", "work experience", or "contact". Responsivity in this project was trivial to develop for because of the simplicity of the layout. I didn't even have to use a grid system because of the fact that nearly all my content was packed into a single middle column. I am a fan of viewport sizing in my CSS so that was how I chose to implement responsivity into this site. </p><p> Finally, I needed a personal logo of some sort. I didn't have very many ideas because of the shortened time frame and the fact that I really didn't like personal logos so I made a circle with a color gradient similar to the photos I had on the site: </p><img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/personallogo.png"/> </div>



<div class="text" id="modal1-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> Hugo is powerful! I definitely didn’t utilize Hugo to its fullest potential because I wanted to get this project out on to the web as quickly as possible. For future development, I’m going to refactor some of my code to use the Hugo templating engine even more so than what I've already done on the site for things like my case studies section or even the work experience section </li><br/> <li> I wish I had taken the time to utilize SCSS. Knowing I was going to take a minimalist design approach, I didn’t think my CSS was going to be to complicated, but perhaps a rule of thumb is to just use it always </li><li> I think I may have simplified too much for my case study modals. I was limited in my positioning a lot of times so I will want to change it in the future </li><br/> </ul> </p></div></div></div></div><div id="caseModal2"> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="modalScroller"> <ul id="topMenu2"> <li class="modalScrollerItem active"><a href="#modal2-1"><span class="modalSubscript">01</span>OVERVIEW</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-2"><span class="modalSubscript">02</span>PROBLEM</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-3"><span class="modalSubscript">03</span>OBJECTIVES</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-4"><span class="modalSubscript">04</span>CONCEPT</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-5"><span class="modalSubscript">05</span>STYLING</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-6"><span class="modalSubscript">06</span>PROTOTYPES</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-7"><span class="modalSubscript">07</span>SOLUTION</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-8"><span class="modalSubscript">08</span>RESULTS</a></li><li class="modalScrollerItem"><a href="#modal2-9"><span class="modalSubscript">09</span>TAKEAWAYS</a></li></ul> <div class="close-caseModal2 btn-close-modal">&lt;- B A C K</div></div>

<div class="toolsBlock"> <span class="toolsTitle">D E V</span> <p>HTML + CSS</p><p>AngularJS</p><p>ServiceNow API</p><p>&nbsp</p><span class="toolsTitle">D E S I G N</span> <p>Sketch</p></div><h1>A R M O U R&nbsp&nbsp D E S K</h1> <div class="modalContent"> <div class="text" id="modal2-1"> <p> Summer 2017 - I had the opportunity to work with the IT Service Management team at Under Armour Global Headquarters where I was tasked with designing an improved interface for employee service delivery. Though my role was initially that of just UI/UX design, I eventually developed the production-ready application as well as migrated existing workflows and service managment data on to the new ServiceNow Portal system. </p><p> This project was my first experience in actually going through an entire development cycle which included conducting extensive UX research for existing pain points, rapidly prototyping new design iterations for review, developing code for not just me but also coworkers/future developers, and working with an already existing (and massive) codebase. </p></div>  


<div class="text" id="modal2-2"> <br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is Armour Desk?</h3> <p> Armour Desk is what Under Armour has decided to call its help desk application for employees. Through Armour Desk, employees are able to log incidents, request laptops, onboard new employees, request building access, etc. Pretty much if an employee needs something, they go to Armour Desk to get it. </p><p> The problem here was that the old Armour Desk (not the one I made) was itself a huge pain point for employees. Thus explains why I was brought onto the team to start with, but regardless, the beginning of my summer at Under Armour consisted of UX research to get a clearer understanding of what the problem with Armour Desk really was at the time. </p><br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">UX - PHASE 01</h3> <p> To start, I sent out a survey to all the IT managers and directors regarding their experiences with Armour Desk. My survey included many different questions down to minute details about the application, but of course, the one that mattered most was simply: </p><h4 style="text-align:center;">Is Armour Desk easy to use?</h4> <p> I recieved replies from about fifteen different users from the initial focus group of managers in IT, and an answer that stuck with me was: </p><p style="text-align:center;"> “I would say <strong>no</strong>. Unless a user has been shown exactly what to select, it's <strong>hard</strong> to know what options to choose.” </p><br/> <h3 style="text-align:center;">UX - PHASE 02</h3> <p> The next step I took in my research was to see the application for myself. From my fresh eyes, I saw the application as unintuitive, dificult to navigate through, and simply outdated in terms of design patterns. </p><img class="oldArmourImages"data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/armourHome.png"/> <p> Shown above was the landing page for Armour Desk. Beyond aesthetic gripes, I identified several big problems including but not limited to: unresponsive site, lack of user guidance, and even an illogical use of the carousel (in this case, the carousel provided no functionality besides rotating backgrounds). </p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/armourCatalog.png"/> <img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/armourRequest.png"/> <p> The process from the service catalog page to making a hardware request (or any other request for that matter) was also something I saw as a factor in why users were having trouble with Armour Desk.<br/> I definitely had to scroll around and look around a lot to find what I needed even for just a simple request for say a wireless mouse. And even for this, the hardware request was the first catalog item I saw since it was listed first - I can imagine if I was not accustomed to Armour Desk and had to look for an obscure request item like ‘telecom request’, I would be wasting time just to find how to make the request. </p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/armourStatus.png"/> <p> The status page was one where I thought the design could be improved, but I was also told it lacked a crucial feature from several managers: a tab for “My Demands”. </p><br/> </div> 

<div class="text" id="modal2-3"> <p> After conducting my preliminary research, I identified a single overarching objective for this project: design for better UX. It was clear to me from my own eyes as well as literal feedback from employees who disliked Armour Desk that the crux of the problem with the app was that it was <strong>tedious</strong>. </p><p> I learned that Under Armour is a company that prides itself on how fast it moves. If processes and workflows are slowing down at all, Under Armour wants to fix it - in this case, I saw how the design and interface of Armour Desk was causing Under Armour to lose precious time to trying to figure out how to utilize employee service delivery. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Design for a better user-guiding interface (i.e. make things easy to find)</li><li>Modernize application aesthetic to current design patterns</li><li>Implement feedback recieved from managers and directors</li><li>Optimize web application loading speeds</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>

<div class="text" id="modal2-4"> <p> One of my objectives was to modernize the design aesthetic of Armour Desk. My manager during my internship was actually the one who designed Armour Desk to begin with and she did all of it way back in 2003! I used the general aesthetic of flat design and I developed with mobile-first in mind. Knowing I was making a help desk application, I concluded that it didn’t have to be complicated at all. </p><h4 style="text-align:center;">K.I.S.S=Keep It Simple Stupid</h4> <p> A common design slogan, this was in the back of my head the entire time I was designing the new Armour Desk. For inspiration, I looked to other help/FAQ websites from other companies - specifically, I looked at tech companies because of the modern design patterns I expected them to utilize. I enjoyed the look of AirBnB’s help page because of its simplicity. </p><img class="oldArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/airbnb.png"/> <br/> <br/> <br/> </div> 


<div class="text" id="modal2-5"> <p> In terms of styling, I followed Under Armour’s branding guidelines. I utilized their general color scheme as well as the custom ‘Armour’ typeface. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset2.png"/> <div id="colorBlock2"> <div id="modal2Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#DC001C</span></div><div id="modal2Color2"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#222628</span></div><div id="modal2Color3"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#D3D6DC</span></div></div></div><div class="text" id="modal2-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Prototypes</h3> <p> Below are some of the mockups I went through before reaching approval on my final design. Several factors had to be considered for the final design as one of the things my manager wanted for the new Armour Desk was robustness and modularity in the design and code. </p><p> She wanted the application to be easily maintained by future developers or members of the team so some ideas had to be scrapped because of the complexity of the design. For example, the service catalog idea had to be scrapped because of the constraints that would come with maintaining it in dev. </p></div>

<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/solution1.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I tried to guide the user to see the search bar first when accessing Armour Desk so that they could utilize it to find what they were looking for, rather than clicking through long lists. </p></div></div>


<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/solution2.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I implemented an autofill feature in the searchbar to include not only hardware/software request items immediately but also knowledge base articles for other common questions and problems </p></div></div>

<div class="showcase"> <div class="solutionBlock"> <img class="newArmourImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/solution3.png"/> <p class="solutionDescription"> I implemented event listeners through the ServiceNow API in the navbar to update common status page items for users to easily access </p></div></div>

Simple tab bar implementation for responsive design at tablet and mobile breakpoints (tab bar spans top of screen on tablet/mobile).

</div><div class="text" id="modal2-8"> <h2 style="text-align:center;">“Under Armour will be the most digitally connected, real-time enterprise on the planet.”</h2> <h3 style="text-align:right;">Kevin Plank<br/>CEO, Under Armour</h3> <p> One of my key objectives was to optimize the Armour Desk web application. I used Google’s Lighthouse analytics software to run tests on the old Armour Desk and my new Armour Desk, and then compared their Perceptual Speed Index (PSI). </p><p> An on average comparison of PSI of pages on both Armour Desk applications: </p><img style="width:100%" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/results1.png"/> <p> Comparing the PSI by ratio, the analytics software determined that my new Armour Desk was <strong>~12x faster</strong> than the old application in terms of page loading time. </p><p> How did I do this? After I had finalized my design, I tested the old Armour Desk application on a variety of fronts such as responsivity, speed, etc. I eventually found that the old application had a whole bunch of client and server scripts running not only when the page loaded, but also throughout the time the user was on the page (like a while-looped function). </p><p> I deduced those scripts were what bogged down the old application’s PSI so in my development I made sure to reduce the amount of scripts and functions the application used overall. All the data on my application was pulled from the ServiceNow instance Under Armour was using so I also minimized the amount of API calls my application was making. </p><p> Since my summer at Under Armour, the Armour Desk application I developed has been put into full production and thousands of employees use it on a daily basis. </p></div>


<div class="text" id="modal2-9"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> I thoroughly enjoyed the process of iterating through design concepts to meet the needs of my team and Under Armour along with putting my own little aesthetic into the final product </li><br/> <li> Picking up a brand new framework and jumping into an existing codebase was a new experience for me. There were days where I couldn’t even look at the existing codebase because I had to look at Angular documentation to understand why even the navbar was rendering the way it was, but this project definitely taught me a lot about looking at and working with somebody else’s code </li><br/> <li> For future projects, I want to allocate more time for testing afterwards. There were definitely some usage patterns that I didn’t think about until after I had completed everything, so I think a greater consideration for UX not only before but after the end of a project is critical </li></ul> </p></div></div></div>

 <div class="modalContent"> <div class="text" id="modal3-1"> <p> I love a minimalistic asesthetic. I enjoy simple and clean interfaces, and I appreciate them even more when I see them executed with my favorite brands. </p><p> Norse Projects is a clothing brand founded by designer Tobia Sloth based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I think the beauty of the Norse aesthetic, especially with regards to its e-commerce site, is its modern simplicity. However, I also think that the simplicity has limited the site in terms of proper user-experience, so this redesign was a concept for the Norse Projects website to better suit the needs of its online consumers. </p></div>



 <div class="text" id="modal3-2"> <p> In doing this redesign, I wanted to make sure I could retain the core aspects of the Norse aesthetic in its simplicity, but also inject more points of interest in the design through textures and patterns. Shown below is how Norse Projects online store looks like right now: </p><img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-1.png"/> <img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-2.png"/> <p> As mentioned previously, I felt that the UX of the site itself could be improved. For instance, one thing that I really enjoy about Norse Projects’ online presence is its frequently updated “Journal”. Specifically, the “Journal” is where Norse releases its seasonal lookbooks, but you would never know it unless you actively went into that part of the site to look for it. </p><p> Of course, the current website does allow user to filter clothing by “season”, but even then, I felt that the website missed out on an opportunity to better showcase its lookbook editorial images. </p><img class="oldNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/oldnorse-3.png"/> <p> With specific regards to the “Journal” page shown above, I felt that it also missed the mark in terms of good UX. Navigation was dificult, and filtering by timestamp for the journal entries was not effectively done. </p></div>


 <div class="text" id="modal3-3"> <p> The overarching theme of my objectives in this redesign project was delightful UX. Not only did I want to conceptualize a slightly more involved website in terms of design, but also allow users to naturally be at the pages they wanted to be at on the site, as well as allow for easy navigation to other parts of the site when needed. </p><p> <h3>Objectives:</h3> <ul> <li>Slight aesthetic revamp</li><li>Highlight the lookbook editorials</li><li>Redesign the "Journal" page for better UX</li></ul> <br/> </p></div>


 <div class="text" id="modal3-4"> <p> Conceptually, I thought the Norse Projects website could better serve its users by focusing on its seasonal editorials so I designed for a lookbook-centered website. I thought this was an effective aspect to focus on because I felt that from my own experience as a consumer, I only went to shop on the Norse Projects website for the new arrivals for a seasonal drop. Generally for me, if I wanted an old piece from a previous collection, I bought it from third-party because either the piece was no longer available on the site, or I could find it at a discounted price elsewhere. Specifically, this lookbook-concept revolves around the Autumn 2017 collection, though I dubbed it FW17 in my design just for fun. </p><p> From an aesthetic standpoint, Norse Projects designers and content creators love highlighting their subject naturally with a white, plain background: </p></div>

<div class="text"> <p> As I mentioned before, my objective was to add a slight complexity to this aesthetic to challenge the the current art direction. I was actually mostly inspired by what Norse has been doing on their instagram with some of their recent collaborations: </p></div>

<div class="text"> <p> The above images illustrate a design that contrasts two defining elements. The elements themselves are still rather simple but, surprisingly enough, complement one another in juxtaposition. </p><br/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-5"> <p> With regards to styling, I mostly kept to Norse Project’s font face, still tried to utilize only monotone colors throughout so there wouldn’t be too much deviation from the current aesthetic, and organized within a 4 column grid. In only one instance did I use Gotham Black for the FW17 collection landing to get a bolder feel to the image. </p><img class="typeImage" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/typeset3.png"/> <div id="colorBlock3"> <div id="modal3Color1"><span style="display:table-cell; vertical-align:middle;">#000000</span></div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-6"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">NORSE PROJECTS <br/>FW17 CAMPAIGN WEBSITE </h3> </div>

<div class="showcase"> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-landing.jpg"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-2.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-3.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-5.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norsestudy-4.png"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-journal.jpg"/> <img class="newNorseImages" data-src="https://tim-kim.github.io/images/norse-mobile.jpg"/> </div>

<div class="text" id="modal3-7"> <h3 style="text-align:center;">Things I Learned:</h3> <p> <ul> <li> This was a design project that pushed my design thinking not because it was an abstract concept or anything, but really more from the fact that I was iterating on someone else’s work and design. Generally, my designs have been inspired and driven from the ground up from my own creativity, but it was a fun experience taking what someone had already created and looking for ways to improve it or aesthetically alter it. </li><br/> <li> Typeface pairing can be dificult when there are constraints to a particular aesthetic you are trying to achieve. There were moments where I really wanted to use a serif font for some of the FW17 campaign materials, but I kept in mind that Norse Projects was a brand that wouldn't use such a font. As a result, I had to work my design to stay in line with the branding of Norse Projects, and I realized that such a dilemma will always be the case when working with real-world clients. </li></ul> </p></div></div></div></div>
